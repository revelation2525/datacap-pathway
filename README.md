# Open-Data-Pathway

Contact: revelation.tech25@gmail.com or @revelation on Filecoin Slack

Background:

Below is an summary of the key client requirements and processes that the Revelation team will follow to oversee proper due diligence while insuring compliance to Fil+ guidelines for DataCap allocations.

Current Scope: 
- Any client looking to onboard an open, public dataset to Filecoin can apply to this allocator pathway. 

Minimum client requirements:
- At least 5 sealed copies of a dataset, stored with 3 separate Storage Provider, each in different regional locations.
- The dataset is made readily retrievable (via an unsealed copy) on the network and can be regularly verified (through the use of manual or automated verification that includes retrieving data over the course of the DataCap allocation timeframe).
- Clients disclose their storage provider partners upfront or designate an approved network tool they will use for SP selection
- Clients are required to apply for DataCap using the following GitHub repo [LINK](https://github.com/revelation2525/datacap-pathway/issues/new/choose) which contains questions related to the client role, data preparation, financing, dataset details, and storage provider distribution plan

Once an application is submitted, diligence to be completed on clients includes:

New User Check
  - Is this a completely new GitHub ID? (less than 2 months old)
  - Is this the first time this GitHub ID has applied for DataCap in this or other allocotor pathways?
  - If yes to either, applicants will have a maximum DataCap allowance for their first application (see allocation breakdown below)

Client ID Check (KYC)
- All applicants will be asked if they are willing to complete a free Know Your Customer (KYC) check to confirm themself as a human user associated with a speicific GitHub ID.
- If they decline the check, they will be significantly limited in the maximum amount of DataCap they can request unless they are able to provide other forms of client identification.
  
Client Business Check (KYB)

If a client is applying as a dataset owner for a commerical dataset, all dataset owner businesses must complete a know your business, KYB, check to confirm the business exists, is legit, and someone from the data owner team (business) has approved onboarding of the dataset. We currently offer two options for KYB check:
Client can request a virtual meeting with the client(lead SP), data owner and member of the allocator team to review the dataset, confirm ownership (proof of employment, employer signoff, sharing the business license) and validate storage of the data by the client/applicant is approved and a contract with the SP(s) is in place. If requested by a client, we will utilize various non-disclosure agreements to collect required information on clients and data-owners while maintaining their privacy.

Storage Provider (SP) Usage Check
Clients are free to select their own SPs. However, if a client does not intend to use SPs from the vetted SP marketplace, or a vetted Protocol Labs network tool (example: SPADE), then they will be required to provide additional proof of business (KYB) information on the SPs they will use to onboard data, in order to get additional allocations approved. Examples of info include: Business license, proof of datacenter address

Note: For users utilizing a GitHub ID older than 2 months and have successfully onboarded public open datasets in the LDN pathway (before 2024)
their onboarding experience will be reviewed to confirm no issues and a positive community reputation. If so, they will be considered a trusted GitHub ID user and can bypass the first allocation schedule above and be considered for the trusted user schedule below.  If not, they will follow the first time user allocation schedule.

Trusted User Allocation Schedule:
- If a user has successfully onboarded a dataset using the First time allocation schedule OR they are a trusted GitHub ID user
AND have completed the third party KYC check or other form of KYC, then they become eligible to apply for up to 10 PiBs of DataCap
- If they have onboarded a dataset successfully in the the past, but they did not complete or chose not to complete any form of KYC check, the max they will be allowed to apply for at any time  is 2 PiBs of DataCap

Note: if first time applicants apply for multiple applications at the same time, only after a completion of one, will the count be included and increased allocation sizes become available.

The allocation schedule for trusted users is:                                     
- 1st allocation         5%
- 2nd allocation        15%
- 3rd allocation        30%
- 4th allocation        50%
