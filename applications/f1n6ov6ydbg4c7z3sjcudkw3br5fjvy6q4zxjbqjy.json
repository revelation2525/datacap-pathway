    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The 3000 Rice Genome Project is an international effort to sequence the genomes of 3,024 rice varieties from 89 countries.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The 3000 Rice Genome Project is an international effort to sequence the genomes of 3,024 rice varieties from 89 countries.\nThis data is available for anyone to use under the terms of the Toronto Statement.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We use AWS-CLI to obtain the file list from the aws cloud, and then use script commands to save the files to the local server. Package the data into a car file according to the set size without changing the directory structure of the original dataset. It is distributed to SP via hard disk mail and http. Then issue the order through boost.",

    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03315260 Germany\nf03367915 United States\nf03542777 Vietnam\nf03603117 United States\nf03100006 HongKong",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
